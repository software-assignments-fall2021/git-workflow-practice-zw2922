"Jeff Connelly covers a few more terms in his 2008 paper “Ternary Computing Testbed 3-Trit Computer Architecture.” A “trit” is the ternary equivalent of a bit. If a bit is a binary digit that can have one of two values, then a trit is a ternary digit that can have any of three values. A trit is one base-3 digit. A “tryte” would be 6 trits. Connelly (and perhaps no one else) defines a “tribble” as half a trit (or one base-27 digit) and he calls one base-9 digit a “nit.” (For more on data measurement, see Understanding Bits, Bytes and Their Multiples.)

It can all become a bit overwhelming,, so we’ll just look at another concept to help us get a grasp of the numbers. Ternary computing deals with three discrete states, but the ternary digits themselves can be defined in different ways, according to Connelly:

Unbalanced Trinary — {0, 1, 2}
Fractional Unbalanced Trinary — {0, 1/2, 1}
Balanced Trinary — {-1, 0, 1}
Unknown-State Logic — {F, ?, T}
Trinary Coded Binary — {T, F, T}"

# My Opinion
We use binary computers these days, but why don't we choose the Ternary Computers? The reasons behind are complicated. But the Ternary Computers can work perfectly and the reasons why it works are also interesting. 

# Comment
The design of Ternary computers are interesting and outline that there might be more ways to design computers. However, because gates only take two inputs, implementing Ternary computers is hard. The article also provides another possible way for computer design, which is quaternary computer. It's interesting that the qubit can exist in mutiple states at once. The superposition of qubits opens a new world of possibilities. As the author states that quantum computers are expected to be exponentially faster than binary or ternary computers, I kindly expect a quantum computer that is millions of times faster than today’s PC.

I find this idea of Ternanty computers interesting, but it leads me to also thinking about quantum computing. There they use Qubits instead and their different states are based on Quantum mechanics. It is heald back mainly by hardware restraints, but you can code in Quantum in the IBM cloud.
